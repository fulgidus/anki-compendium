# Usage Instructions for PM

## When to Use This Template
Use for AgentTasks scored 0-2 complexity points:
- Fix typo
- Adjust config value
- Update documentation
- Simple refactor
- One-line bug fix

## Template Population Steps

1. **Identify Simple Change** (0-2 points)
   - Single file only
   - <50 lines of code
   - No external dependencies
   - No security implications

2. **Provide File Path**
   - Exact absolute path to file
   - Line numbers if known

3. **Define Change Clearly**
   - What needs to change
   - Expected behavior after change

4. **Set Simple Validation**
   - How to verify it works
   - Manual testing steps

5. **Assign to Specialist**
   - Choose appropriate role
   - Ensure context is clear

## Quality Checklist Before Delegation

- [ ] File path is absolute and correct
- [ ] Change is clearly described
- [ ] Success criteria is measurable
- [ ] Verification steps provided
- [ ] Specialist role appropriate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Underestimating complexity
❌ Missing file path
❌ Vague change description
❌ No verification steps

✅ Clear, specific change request
✅ Exact file location
✅ Simple verification method
