# Usage Instructions for PM

## When to Use This Template
Use for AgentTasks scored 3-5 complexity points:
- Add validation logic
- Add missing field to model
- Small UI component
- Simple API endpoint
- Configuration update

## Template Population Steps

1. **Analyze Complexity** (3-5 points)
   - File impact: 2-5 files
   - Code volume: 50-200 lines
   - Minimal integrations
   - Low complexity

2. **Search Memory First**
   ```
   Search memory/Pattern/ for relevant patterns
   Search memory/Learning/ for solutions
   Embed findings in embedded_learnings
   ```

3. **Gather Context**
   - Get project root path
   - Load relevant code standards
   - Find similar examples in codebase

4. **Define Goal Clearly**
   - One sentence summary
   - 2 measurable success criteria
   - Business value statement

5. **Plan Implementation**
   - High-level approach
   - Step-by-step tasks (2-3 steps)
   - Files to modify

6. **Set Validation Criteria**
   - Basic test requirements
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Manual testing steps

7. **Assign to Specialist**
   - Choose appropriate role
   - Provide complete context

## Quality Checklist Before Delegation

- [ ] All {PLACEHOLDERS} replaced
- [ ] Memory search results embedded
- [ ] File paths absolute
- [ ] Success criteria measurable
- [ ] Validation steps clear
- [ ] Specialist role appropriate

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Overcomplicating simple tasks
❌ Missing memory search
❌ Vague success criteria
❌ Incomplete file paths

✅ Focused, clear context
✅ Memory patterns included
✅ Specific implementation steps
✅ Clear validation
